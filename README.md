# [Project 1: AirBnB bookings in Rio de Janeiro for 2016](https://github.com/AzumA19/AirBnB-bookings-in-Rio-de-Janeiro-for-2016-.git)

This is a project I did for the BrainStation Data analytics course, where I transfomred and analysed Airbnb data for bookings in Rio de Janeiro in 2016.

* Data was taken from *Interview Query*
* Used Microsoft Excel to slice and filter data using pivot tables
* Used SQL to find joins and other useful statistics about the data
* Visualised data in Tableau
